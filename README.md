# Watnanong School website

A new 2024 semi-stasic site https://watnanong.netlify.app I do plan implementing the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) but with point recording, grading system.

## Tech Stack

- Astro
- Bulma CSS + TailwindCSS
- Netlify
- SASS
- Prettier

### Note

Cannot optimize images. After `npm run build`, the images are not optimized and the file size still remains the same. Tried to `npm install sharp` manually. It also did not work.
